                            A strawberry shake is a blended beverage made with strawberries, milk, and ice cream. It is typically sweet, creamy, and served chilled, often topped with whipped cream or additional strawberries for garnish. </p>

                        <p><br>Fresh Strawberries (or frozen) - 1 cup, hulled
                            <br>Milk - 1 cup (use whole milk for a creamier shake, or plant-based milk if preferred)
                            <br>Vanilla Ice Cream - 2-3 scoops (adjust for desired thickness)
                            <br>Sugar or Sweetener - 1-2 tablespoons (optional, depending on the sweetness of the strawberries)
                            <br>Ice Cubes (optional) - A few, for extra chill or to adjust thickness
                           <br><b><u><i>Optional Toppings:</i></u></b>
                            <br>Whipped Cream
                            <br>Strawberry Syrup
                            <br>Fresh Strawberry Slices
                            <br>Sprinkles
                        
                        </p>
                        <h3>Instruction:</h3>
                        <p><br><b><u>Prepare Strawberries:</u></b>
                            Wash the strawberries and hull them (remove the green tops). If using frozen strawberries, let them thaw slightly for better blending.
                            <br><b><u>Blend the Shake:</u></b>
                            Add the strawberries, milk, ice cream, and sugar into a blender. Blend until smooth and creamy. If you'd like a thinner consistency, add a little extra milk.
                            <br><b><u>Adjust Sweetness and Thickness:</u></b>
Taste the shake. If it needs more sweetness, add extra sugar or honey and blend again. For a thicker shake, add another scoop of ice cream. For a frostier texture, add ice cubes and blend.
<br><b><u>Serve:</u></b>

                            <br>1 tspn of pepper
                            <br>1 tspn of salt

                        <h3>Instruction:</h3>
                        <p><br>1. If your chicken breasts are too big, slice them before cooking. Then, marinade the chicken breasts in the Worcestershire sauce, pepper, salt, mustard, or all-spice powder. Leave the chicken for at least four hours or over night.
                            <br>2. An egg and two tablespoons of water should be beaten together to make the batter, which should then be set aside.
                            <br>3. Chicken breasts that have been marinated should be heavily dusted in flour. They should be well coated after being dipped in both the egg and the breadcrumbs.
                            <br>4. The coated chicken breasts should be deep-fried in heated oil over a medium-high heat until they are crisp and golden brown.
                            <br>5. The finished burger should be stacked with the lettuce on top, followed by the chicken, and then the mayonnaise or KFC zinger sauce. The buns should be cut in half and lightly toasted. If you'd like a cheesy kick, add some sliced American cheese.

                        <p class="meal-descript-about">If there's one thing that could make a non-morning person scramble out of their bed before noon (your delivery rider calling you doesn't count, by the way), it's the intoxicating smell of sinangag (fried garlic rice), fried egg, and of course, tapa wafting through the air from the kitchen and into your room.

                        <p><br>1 lb. beef sirloin sliced thinly
                            <br>3 pieces eggs
                            <br>6 tablespoons cooking oil
                            <br><b>Tapa marinade</b>
                            <br>3 tablespoons Knorr Liquid Seasoning
                            <br>6 cloves crushed garlic
                            <br>¾ cups pineapple juice
                            <br>2 tablespoons brown sugar
                            <br>¼ teaspoon ground white pepper
                            <br><b>Sinangag</b>
                            <br>5 cups leftover rice
                            <br>1 teaspoon salt
                            <br>5 cloves garlic crushed
                        </p>
                        <h3>Instruction:</h3>
                        <p><br>1. Prepare the tapa by placing the beef in a large bowl. Combine with all the tapa marinade ingredients. Mix well and cover the bowl. Place inside the fridge and marinate overnight.
                            <br>2. Cook the garlic fried rice (sinangag na kanin) by heating 3 tablespoons cooking oil in a pan. Add crushed garlic. Cook until garlic turns light brown. Add the leftover rice. Stir-fry for 3 minutes.
                            <br>3. Season with salt. Continue to stir-fry for 3 to 5 minutes. Set aside.
                            <br>4. Start to cook the tapa. Heat a pan and pour the marinated beef into it, including the marinade. Add ¾ cups water. Let the mixture boil. Cover the pan and continue to cook until the liquid reduces to half. Add 3 tablespoons cooking oil into the mixture. Continue to cook until the liquid completely evaporates. Fry the beef tapa in remaining oil until medium brown. Set aside.
                            <br>5. Fry the egg by pouring 1 tablespoon oil on a pan. Crack a piece of egg and sprinkle enough salt on top. Cook for 30 seconds. Pour 2 tablespoons water on the side of the pan. Cover and let the water boil. Continue to cook until the egg yolks gets completely cooked by the steam.
                            <br>6. Arrange the beef tapa, sinangag, and fried egg on a large plate to form Tapsilog. Serve with vinegar as dipping sauce for tapa.

                            <br>1 lbs Yukon gold potatoes, diced into bite sized pieces

                            <br>½ teaspoon coarse salt
                            <br>4 eggs
                            <br>¼ cup mozzarella cheese, grated
                            <br>¼ cup cheddar cheese, grated
                            <br>Extra virgin olive oil for extra drizzling
                            <br>Fresh cilantro roughly chopped, thinly sliced chives for garnish
                        </p>
                        <h3>Instruction:</h3>
                        <p><br>1. Preheat oven to 400˚F. Place strips of bacon in a large (at least 10 inch), oven safe skillet. Cook over medium low heat on both sides until cooked through but not yet crispy, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat to a paper towel lined plate and set aside, leaving the bacon grease in the pan. When the bacon is cool enough to handle, roughly dice.
                            <br>Increase the heat to medium high, add the potatoes, bell pepper, and onion and cook for 7- 8 minutes, stirring frequently, until starting to soften and can be pierced with a fork
                            <br>Add garlic, cumin, chili powder, paprika, black pepper, and salt. Cook for 1-2 minutes, until garlic is fragrant.
                            <br>Using a spoon, create 4 to 6 holes (depending on how many eggs you want) in the hash mixture for the eggs. Distribute the cheeses evenly into each hole, and then crack one egg into each hole.
                            <br>Place in the preheat oven and cook for 8-10 minutes, until egg white is set but the yolk is still runny.
                            <br>Remove from heat. Sprinkle with cooked bacon. Garnish with fresh ground black pepper, cilantro and chives.
